# This module includes (almost) everything necessary to add dogecoin support
# to bitcoin-ruby. When switching to a :dogecoin network, it will load its
# functionality into the Script class and the Storage backend.
# The only things not included here should be parsing the AuxPow, which is
# done in Protocol::Block directly, and passing the txout to #store_doge from
# the storage backend.
